# My Snake Game
This is a version of the classic Google Snake game made with Python using the pygame library.

## How to Play:
Use arrow keys to move the snake around and try to get to the red blocks. The game is slightly different as there are two food blocks and when you eat one, another one appears rather than when you eat both food blocks. Don't bump into a wall as this will end the game and follow the instructions on the screen.
Sorry this is not mobile friendly.

## Credits:
- I followed a tutorial from Youtube, which contained the majority of the code: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bBgyOkoBQ0&t=1s&pp=ygUMcHlnYW1lIHNuYWtl)
Although this tutorial was not the clearest and the code was not fully working so I had to edit it a bit. I also edited it to have more than one food block and changed the colours.

## Note:
Sorry the playable screen size may not be ideal. I have set it to 480x480 pixels and forgot to change it.
